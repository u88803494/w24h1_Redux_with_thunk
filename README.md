## 作業目的
1. 美化整個頁面
2. 新增、刪除、編輯功能實現
3. 用 Redux 來儲存分頁狀態

## 作業思考
### 1. 美化畫面
這部分會去參考一下 wordpess 的部落格，選一個自己喜歡的也不要太複雜的直接實作。
ps. 同時間也要把新增、編輯、刪除的按鈕寫上去以及如何呈現也要想好。

#### 可參考模板
決定後再來寫


### 2. 文章功能實現
#### 新增

#### 刪除

#### 編輯

#### 分頁功能
有思考要把文章作成可以分頁的功能，然後每次抓資料都只抓需要的範圍？不過這需要 API 支援
而這部分當然是直接把資料存在 store 裡面了。

### 3. Redux

## 變動的內容

# cra 內建說明
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
